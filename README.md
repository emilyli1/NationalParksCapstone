# NationalParksCapstone
This Capstone allows users to find information on Mountains and Parks. There is 3 pages; Home page, a page for parks, and a page for mountains. 
The Home page should have a working carousel and nav bar that leads to the other pages.
The parks page should allow users to filter parks either by state or by their park type. The states and park types would have a drop down menu.
 When you click on a specific state and park type, it will show the parks. 
The mountains page should allow users to get information on specific mountains from a drop down menu.
The mountains card should also include a picture along with the information.
